# Book-Inventory-demo

JAVA Component:
This Github Repository is to demonstrate a simple Book Inventory application using Spring Boot and Java, as well as MySQL as the database. This code is developed on IntelliJ IDEA and I recommend you to do so too.

This application serves as a Book Inventory where you can:
1. Add new books
2. Remove existing books
3. Update the quantity of each book
4. Retrieve the quantity in stock of a given book
5. List all books in the inventory

Things To Note:
1. This repository only contains the Spring Boot and Java code
2. Please connect to your MySQL server locally, as there may be credential issues: username and password

After connecting the this codebase to your MySQL server in your localhost, please change the credentials in the application.properties folder accordingly
1. spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/BookInventory
2. spring.datasource.username=root
3. spring.datasource.password=Mysql123

SQL Component:
The SQL Queries for the SQL Assignment - 6 Questions can be found in the SQL Queries folder.
